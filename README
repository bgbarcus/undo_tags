Undo branches are a very cool feature in vim7, which I recently discovered.
You can navigate through the change history of the current session as
long as you do not run out of undolevels.

This small plugin lets you:
-  Assign tags / names and description to points in the buffers change history
-  List the tags / names
-  Choose a tag / name to revert back
